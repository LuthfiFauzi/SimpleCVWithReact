      <h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1>
      <p>
        I am a telecommunications engineer. I have some experience working on
        the telecommunication industry. In 2017, I attended the apprenticeship
        period at PT Adyawinsa Telecommunication and Electrical. At the company
        I learned a lot of knowledge about the radio telecommunication industry.
        Installing and fixing the Node B 4G problem is my activity at that time.
        And until now I am a Telecommunication Engineering student at Telkom
        University. I attended several organizations and research. Research that
        I follow is the internet device research of things to anticipate flood
        disaster. In addition, I also participate researching robot art dance
        for Kontes Robot Indonesia event. My final project research is the
        design of fiber optic network for high rise building solution in
        cooperation with PT Telkom Akses.
